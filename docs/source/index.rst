The psrqpy package
==================

.. automodule:: psrqpy

This package provides a way to directly query the `ATNF Pulsar Catalogue <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat/>`_ [1]_ using Python.
It is primarily aimed at astronomers wanting access to the latest pulsar information via a script,
rather than through the standard web interface.

Other functionality that it includes:

 * it can produce a :math:`P-\dot{P}` :ref:`diagram <make-p-pdot-diagram>` using the latest catalogue information.
 * a function (:func:`~psrqpy.utils.get_glitch_catalogue`) to access the `Jodrell Bank pulsar glitch catalogue <http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/glitches.html>`_.

Installation
============

This package can be installed using ``pip`` via ``pip install psrqpy``. Alternatively
the source code can be obtained from `github <https://github.com/mattpitkin/psrqpy>`_, and installed using::

    python setup.py install

with ``sudo`` if wanted to install system wide, and with the ``--user`` flag
if just installing for an individual user.

Requirements
------------

The requirements for installing the code are:

 * :mod:`six`
 * :mod:`requests`
 * :mod:`bs4`
 * :mod:`numpy`
 * :mod:`astropy` (for Python 2 astropy versions before `3.0 <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/whatsnew/3.0.html#whatsnew-3-0-python3>`_ must be used)
 * :mod:`datetime`

The :mod:`ads` module and :mod:`matplotlib` are optional requirement to get the full functionality.

Examples
========

You can query the ATNF catalogue for any combination of the pulsar parameters listed
`here <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/psrcat_help.html?type=expert#par_list>`_.

A simple example of a query is to get the frequency 'F0' for all pulsars in the catalogue. By default the
`'JName' <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/psrcat_help.html?type=normal&highlight=jname#jname>`_
(pulsar name based on the J2000 coordinates) parameter will also always be returned by default. This could be done with

   >>> from psrqpy import QueryATNF
   >>> query = QueryATNF(params=['F0'])

where the parameter names are case insensitive. The returned :class:`~psrqpy.search.QueryATNF` query willbe stored as an :class:`astropy.table.Table`, which can be accessed via

   >>> qtable = query.table

The number of pulsars can easily be accessed, e.g.,

   >>> numstring = 'Version {} of the ATNF catalogue contains {} pulsars'
   >>> print(numstring.format(query.get_version, query.num_pulsars))
   Version 1.57 of the ATNF catalogue contains 2627 pulsars

The code will automatically attempt to query the current version of the
ATNF catalogue, the value of which is printed in the above example.

.. note::

   If you really want to query the catalogue many times in quick succession it is advisable not to use this module, as
   it could result in too much load on the ATNF catalogue's server. Instead it is probably preferable to `download
   the catalogue <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/download.html>`_ and query it with the ``psrcat`` software
   provided.

A function, :func:`~psrqpy.utils.get_catalogue`, is also available to download the entire catalogue and return it as an
:class:`astropy.table.Table`. This function is heavily based on
`code <https://github.com/astrophysically/ATNF-Pulsar-Cat/blob/master/ATNF.ipynb>`_ by Joshua Tan
(`@astrophysically <https://github.com/astrophysically/>`_). The function currently does not return parameter uncertainties
or references in the table.

More complex queries
--------------------

**Setting conditions**

You can set `logical conditions <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/psrcat_help.html#condition>`_
on the parameters that you query. Let's say you want the names of all pulsars with rotation frequencies between
100 and 200 Hz, then (because the name is always queried by default) you could do the following:

    >>> from psrqpy import QueryATNF
    >>> query = QueryATNF(condition='F0 > 100 && F0 < 200')
    >>> print(len(query))
    82

If you also wanted pulsars with this condition, but also in globular clusters, you could do

    >>> query = QueryATNF(condition='F0 > 100 && F0 < 200', assoc='GC')
    >>> print(len(query))
    33

This is equivalent to having ``condition='F0 > 100 && F0 < 200 && assoc(GC)'``.

**Save a query**

You can save a query as a `pickled object <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ for later
use, e.g., if using a previous ``query`` we had done:

    >>> query.save('atnfquery.pkl')

Then we could reload this with

   >>> oldquery = QueryATNF(loadfromfile='atnfquery.pkl')

**Query specific pulsars**

We might just want to get information on certain pulsars, such as the Crab pulsar (J0534+2200) and
J0537-6910, then we could get their sky positions with:

    >>> from psrqpy import QueryATNF
    >>> query = QueryATNF(params=['RAJ', 'DECJ'], psrs=['J0534+2200', 'J0537-6910'])
    >>> print(query.table)
       JNAME        RAJ      RAJ_ERR     DECJ     DECJ_ERR
    ---------- ------------ ------- ------------ --------
    J0534+2200 05:34:31.973   0.005 +22:00:52.06     0.06
    J0537-6910 05:37:47.416    0.11 -69:10:19.88      0.6

You can also access these pulsars using the :class:`psrqpy.pulsar.Pulsars` class. This
will create a dictionary of :class:`psrqpy.pulsar.Pulsar` objects keyed on the pulsar
names. The attributes of the :class:`~psrqpy.pulsar.Pulsar` objects are the parameters
that have been retrieved by the query. But, the  :class:`~psrqpy.pulsar.Pulsar` objects
themselves can query the ATNF catalogue if you request a parameter that they don't already
contain. E.g., so first lets get the :class:`psrqpy.pulsar.Pulsars`:

    >>> psrs = query.get_pulsars()
    >>> for psr in psrs:
    ...     print(psr)
    J0534+2200
    J0537-6910

    >>> print(psrs['J0534+2200'].keys()) # show attributes of the psr class
    ['DECJ', 'RAJ', 'DECJ_ERR', 'RAJ_ERR', 'JNAME']

What if we want the frequency of J0534+2200? Well we just have to do

    >>> crab = psrs['J0534+2200']
    >>> print(crab.F0)
    29.946923

We can also get the whole ephemeris for the Crab with

    >>> print(crab.get_ephemeris())
    PSRJ            J0534+2200
    PSRB            B0531+21
    NAME            B0531+21
    RAJ             05:34:31.973             5.000e-03
    DECJ            +22:00:52.06             6.000e-02
    ELONG           84.10
    ELAT            -1.29
    DM              56.77118                 2.400e-04
    PEPOCH          48442.5
    F0              29.946923                1.000e-06
    F1              -3.77535E-10             2.000e-15
    P0              0.0333924123             1.200e-09
    P1              4.20972E-13              3.000e-18
    DIST_DM         1.31
    ...

**Query pulsars within a circular boundary**

We can query the catalogue to only return pulsars within a `circular boundary <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/psrcat_help.html?type=normal#boundary>`_ defined
by a central right ascension and declination, and with a given radius (in degrees).

    >>> from psrqpy import QueryATNF
    >>> # set the boundary circle centre (RAJ then DECJ) and radius
    >>> c = ['12:34:56.7', '-02:54:12.3', 10.]
    >>> query = QueryATNF(params=['RAJ', 'DECJ'], circular_boundary=c)
    >>> print(query.table)
      JNAME     RAJ  RAJ_ERR  DECJ  DECJ_ERR
    ---------- ----- ------- ------ --------
    J1142+0119 11:42     0.0 +01:19      0.0

The circle's coordinates can also be define as, e.g.:

    >>> c = ['12h34m56.7s', '-02d54m12.3s', 10.]

Or, in radians, as:

    >>> c = [3.29406898, -0.05067418, 10.]

**Return a reference**

We can make use of the `ADS module <https://ads.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to return links to references for pulsars/pulsar parameters.
For example we could get the reference for the orbital period of J0737-3039A with

    >>> from psrqpy import QueryATNF
    >>> query = QueryATNF(params='PB', psrs='J0737-3039A', include_refs=True, adsref=True)
    >>> print(query.table['PB_REFURL'][0])
    https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2006Sci...314...97K/

.. _make-p-pdot-diagram:

**Make a P-Pdot diagram**

You can generate a *lovely* period vs. period derivative diagram based on the latest catalogue information
using the :func:`~psrqpy.search.ppdot` function in just three lines of code:

    >>> from psrqpy import QueryATNF
    >>> query = QueryATNF(params=['P0', 'P1', 'ASSOC', 'BINARY', 'TYPE', 'P1_I'])
    >>> query.ppdot(showSNRs=True, showtypes='all')

where this shows all pulsar types and pulsars in supernova remnants, to give
