# Notable changes between versions

## [1.0.0] 2018-11-15

This release involves major changes to the API.

- PSRQpy now downloads the full ATNF Pulsar Catalogue database and stores it internally.
- PSRQpy will no longer generate queries of the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue via the web interface.
- Derived parameters are calculated internally rather than being values returned be the catalogue web interface.
- Full string paper references are no longer included in the output table, but can be returned using the `parse_ref`
method of the `QueryATNF` class.
